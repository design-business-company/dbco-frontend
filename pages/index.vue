        re poems’ in the Georgian style. I also, about twice, attempted a short
        story which was a ghastly failure. That was the total of the would-be
        serious work that I actually set down on paper during all those years.
        However, throughout this time I did in a sense engage in literary
        activities. To begin with there was the made-to-order stuff which I
        produced quickly, easily and without much pleasure to myself. Apart from
        school work, I wrote vers d’occasion, semi-comic poems which I could
        turn out at what now seems to me astonishing speed – at fourteen I wrote
        a whole rhyming play, in imitation of Aristophanes, in about a week –
        and helped to edit school magazines, both printed and in manuscript.
        These magazines were the most pitiful burlesque stuff that you could
        imagine, and I took far less trouble with them than I now would with the
        cheapest journalism. But side by side with all this, for fifteen years
        or more, I was carrying out a literary exercise of a quite different
        kind: this was the making up of a continuous “story” about myself, a
        sort of diary existing only in the mind. I believe this is a common
        habit of children and adolescents. As a very small child I used to
        imagine that I was, say, Robin Hood, and picture myself as the hero of
        thrilling adventures, but quite soon my “story” ceased to be
        narcissistic in a crude way and became more and more a mere description
        of what I was doing and the things I saw. For minutes at a time this
        kind of thing would be running through my head: ‘He pushed the door open
        and entered the room. A yellow beam of sunlight, filtering through the
        muslin curtains, slanted on to the table, where a matchbox, half-open,
        lay beside the inkpot. With his right hand in his pocket he moved across
        to the window. Down in the street a tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead
        leaf,’ etc., etc. This habit continued until I was about twenty-five,
        right through my non-literary years. Although I had to search, and did
        search, for the right words, I seemed to be making this descriptive
        effort almost against my will, under a kind of compulsion from outside.
        The ‘story’ must, I suppose, have reflected the styles of the various
        writers I admired at different ages, but so far as I remember it always
        had the same meticulous descriptive quality. When I was about sixteen I
        suddenly discovered the joy of mere words, i.e. the sounds and
        associations of words. The lines from Paradise Lost – So hee with
        difficulty and labour hard Moved on: with difficulty and labour hee,
        which do not now seem to me so very wonderful, sent shivers down my
        backbone; and the spelling ‘hee’ for ‘he’ was an added pleasure. As for
        the need to describe things, I knew all about it already. So it is clear
        what kind of books I wanted to write, in so far as I could be said to
        want to write books at that time. I wanted to write enormous
        naturalistic novels with unhappy endings, full of detailed descriptions
        and arresting similes, and also full of purple passages in which words
        were used partly for the sake of their sound. And in fact my first
        completed novel, Burmese Days, which I wrote when I was thirty but
        projected much earlier, is rather that kind of book. I give all this
        background information because I do not think one can assess a writer’s
        motives without knowing something of his early development. His
        subject-matter will be determined by the age he lives in ­– at least
        this is true in tumultuous, revolutionary ages like our own – but before
        he ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from
        which he will never completely escape. It is his job, no doubt, to
        discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at some immature
        stage, or in some perverse mood: but if he escapes from his early
        influences altogether, he will have killed his impulse to write. Putting
        aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four great motives
        for writing, at any rate for writing prose. They exist in different
        degrees in every writer, and in any one writer the proportions will vary
        from time to time, according to the atmosphere in which he is living.
        They are: (i) Sheer egoism. Desire to seem clever, to be talked about,
        to be remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who
        snubbed you in childhood, etc., etc. It is humbug to pretend this is not
        a motive, and a strong one. Writers share this characteristic with
        scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers, soldiers, successful business
        men – in short, with the whole top crust of humanity. The great mass of
        human beings are not acutely selfish. After the age of about thirty they
        abandon individual ambition – in many cases, indeed, they almost abandon
        the sense of being individuals at all – and live chiefly for others, or
        are simply smothered under drudgery. But there is also the minority of
        gifted, willful people who are determined to live their own lives to the
        end, and writers belong in this class. Serious writers, I should say,
        are on the whole more vain and self-centered than journalists, though
        less interested in money. (ii) Aesthetic enthusiasm. Perception of
        beauty in the external world, or, on the other hand, in words and their
        right arrangement. Pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in
        the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story. Desire to
        share an experience which one feels is valuable and ought not to be
        missed. The aesthetic motive is very feeble in a lot of writers, but
        even a pamphleteer or writer of textbooks will have pet words and
        phrases which appeal to him for non-utilitarian reasons; or he may feel
        strongly about typography, width of margins, etc. Above the level of a
        railway guide, no book is quite free from aesthetic considerations.
        (iii) Historical impulse. Desire to see things as they are, to find out
        true facts and store them up for the use of posterity. (iv) Political
        purpose re poems’ in the Georgian style. I also, about twice, attempted
