        >Micro. I give all this background information because I do not think
        one can assess a writer’s motives without knowing something of his early
        development. His subject-matter will be determined by the age he lives
        in ­– at least this is true in tumultuous, revolutionary ages like our
        own – but before he ever begins to write he will have acquired an
        emotional attitude from which he will never completely escape. It is his
        job, no doubt, to discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at
        some immature stage, or in some perverse mood: but if he escapes from
        his early influences altogether, he will have killed his impulse to
        write. Putting aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four
        great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose. They exist in
        different degrees in every writer, and in any one writer the proportions
        will vary from time to time, according to the atmosphere in which he is
        living. They are:
